# Open 3000+ ports

	It seems you haven’t opened port 3000 for external use. You’ll need to open it in order for you to be able to reach your application on the said port.

	If you are using UFW, you can execute
		sudo ufw allow 3000

	If you are using only IPtables, you can execute
		iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT
